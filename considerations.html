			<h1>Considerations</h1>

			<h2>Compromise</h2>
			<p>When using a mobile device connected to a cellular network your location is able to be tracked, including by IMSI-catcher devices that can spoof cell tower signals in order to connect devices to it. This means that this guide will not protect you from tracking by government agencies and therefore is not suitable if that is a part of your threat model.
			
			<h2>Responsibility</h2>
			<p>By following some steps in this guide you risk damaging your device in a potentially unrecoverable way. While this is very unlikely if you follow steps carefully, I take no responsibility for any damage caused.</p>
			
			<h2>Balancing privacy and useability</h2>
			<p>Before proceeding you should consider how important privacy is for you personally. This guide is not meant to convince you one way or another, however it is important to understand that taking steps to increase privacy with any software can reduce useability in cases. Being thorough is the most effective way to secure your privacy however this guide is made so you can choose only the changes you want.
		
			<h2>Alternatives</h2>
			<h4>Pinephone</h4>
			<p>~$150 smartphone capable of running a number of mobile and desktop Linux distros. Kill switches for modem, WiFi, microphones, and both cameras seperatley. While many distros look promising and run stable, Android apps are not supported meaning a major loss in useability. This will likely get better as more people get their hands on them.
			<h4>Librem 5</h4>
			<p>~$750 smartphone with the same use case and advantages/problems as the PinePhone. Fewer kill switches (modem, WiFi, linked cameras and audio) but slightly better specs overall.
			<h4>iOS</h4>
			<p>While nowhere near as extensive as a hardened Android install, iOS is better than a stock Android device in terms of privacy. Google is a company who's revenue comes from targeted advertisements that use user data whereas Apple profits mainly from hardware sales. It should also be kept in mind that iOS is closed source, meaning that the legitimacy of many of their claims when it comes to privacy are not able to be proved entirely.
