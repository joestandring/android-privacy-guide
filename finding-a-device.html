			<h2>Unlockable bootloader</h2>
			<p>When looking for devices you should make sure that they have an unlockable bootloader. This is vital if you plan on installing a custom ROM as it is required for a custom recovery (e.g. TWRP). While some manufacturers will have bootloaders that can be unlocked freely, others require you to request access from the manufacturer which means you may end up waiting up to weeks to be able to unlock the device. Some manufacturers such as Xaiomi have exploitative processes that require users to input personal data and connect their device to their servers before they can send a request. Be sure to review the unlocking process for each device you consider as almost every manufacturer handles this differently.
			
			<h2>ROM availability</h2>
			<p>It is important to check the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA Developer Forums</a> to ensure that a device has a stable, active ROM community with official releases. While other privacy-focused roms are available, checking to see if the device has a maintained official version of LineageOS is a good indicator.
		
			<h2>Hardware kill switches</h2>
			<p>Having kill switches built in is extremely rare, however allow the user to know with confidence their devices cameras, microphones, and networking features are not being used. By physically cutting off these features until you need to use them, you reduce the risk of applications using them in the background. Currently there are no commercially available Android devices with killswitches available, however some phones allow for hardware to be replaced to be potentially more privacy respecting.

            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>The following are some devices that meet the majority of the above requirements. Keep in mind that outside of privacy specialised devices (see <a href="./considerations.html">considerations</a>) it is extremely uncommon to find phones with hardware kill switches and therefore this will be ignored here until one is found. Additionally, almost all manufacturers will require you to request an unlock key via their website or by making an account. While most manufacturers only require you to make an account with minimal personal information, some processes are intentionaly exploitative to gather as much personal information as possible or require (sometimes really awfully made) first party tools. It is reccomended to do your own research in addition, as this list may not always be up to date.</p>

					<p>Roughly equivelant hardware to the Moto G7 however has the advantage of being almost entirely modular and having a simpler bootloader unlocking process. Id reccomend using the /e/ ROM (based on LineageOS) that can be installed by deafult if bought through /e/OS's <a href="https://esolutions.shop/shop/e-os-fairphone-3/">website</a>.</p>

                    <p>A very good option especially for it's price. While not as simple as the Fairphone, the G7 has a more active ROM community, with an official LineageOS build. While the unlocking process isn't quite as simple, it is still privacy respecting and faster than most services that require waiting for approval from the manufacturer.</p>

                    <p>Compared to the other two devices, the 7 Pro was a flagship device meaning that it is more expensive but with much nicer hardware. Like the Fairphone, the unlocking process is extremely easy and does not require authorization from the manufacturer. It also has a very active ROM community with an official LineageOS build.</p>
