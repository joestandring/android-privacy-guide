			<h2>Unlockable bootloader</h2>
			<p>When looking for devices you should make sure that they have an unlockable bootloader. This is vital if you plan on installing a custom ROM as it is required for a custom recovery (e.g. TWRP). While some manufacturers will have bootloaders that can be unlocked freely, others require you to request access from the manufacturer which means you may end up waiting up to weeks to be able to unlock the device. Some manufacturers such as Xaiomi have exploitative processes that require users to input personal data and connect their device to their servers before they can send a request. Be sure to review the unlocking process for each device you consider as almost every manufacturer handles this differently.
			
			<h2>ROM availability</h2>
			<p>It is important to check the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDF Developer Forums</a> to ensure that a device has a stable, active ROM community with official releases. While other privacy-focused roms are available, checking to see if the device has a maintained official version of LineageOS is a good indicator.
		
			<h2>Hardware kill switches</h2>
			<p>Having kill switches built in is extremely rare, however allow the user to know with confidence their devices cameras, microphones, and networking features are not being used. By physically cutting off these features until you need to use them, you reduce the risk of applications using them in the background. Currently the only Android device with this feature built in I know of is the Fairphone 3.
