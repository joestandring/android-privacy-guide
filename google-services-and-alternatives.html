            <h2>What does Google Play Services do?</h2>
            <p>Google Play Services is a collection of APIs and services that run in the background whenever your device is powered. Contrary to what the majority of articles say, you do NOT need Google Play Services for Android to run. It does, however, provide apps a way to use various Google utilities that can increase useability. Examples of services included with Google Play Services include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Cloud Messaging</a></b>: Allows apps to send push notifications</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/location-context">Location APIs</a></b>: Provides apps information regarding the device's location</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/android/sdk">Google Mobile Ads SDK</a></b>: Lets apps implement advertisements provided by Google. These use data such as Location, search activity, and other user activity to "tailor" advertisements for individual users</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60224?hl=en">Google Sign-In (SSO)</a></b>: Allows users to sign in just once for all apps</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation">Maps API</a></b>: Allows apps to implement google maps within the application without having to open it externally</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/android/intro">Google Drive Android API</a></b>: Allows apps to interact with Google Drive to access and modify files</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/games/services">Google Play Games Services</a></b>: Lets games use Google Cloud services to host data and implement leaderboards and achievements</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/cast">Google Cast SDK</a></b>: Provides apps the ability to stream media to other devices using Google Cast</li>
                <li><b><a href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/overview">Google Pay API</a></b>: Allows apps to use payment information stored with Google Pay</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, some apps may not work at all without Google Play Services (or an alternative) installed.</p>
            
            <h2>Alternatives</h2>
            <p>For the majority of users, some form of implementation of/alternative to Google Play Services is necessary for the majority of tasks they would perform on an Android device. There are two main alternatives to using the proprietary implementation of Google Play Services that aim to restore the majority (if not all of) the functionality to a ROM that does not include it.</p>

            <h4>Open GApps <a href="https://opengapps.org/"><i class="fa fa-globe"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></h4>
            <p>Open GApps is an open-source reimplementation of various Google apps and services, that allow for you install them on ROMs not including them by default. <b>Open GApps does not provide an open-source, privacy-respecting alternative to Google Play Services</b> but instead simply provides a way for them to be installed. If you use Open GApps you have the same level of privacy on your device as if you were using preinstalled Google Play Services.</p>

            <h4>microG <a href="https://https://microg.org/"><i class="fa fa-globe"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/microg"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></h4>
            <p>An actual alternative to using Google Play Services is the microG Project. This provides an open-source re-implementation of the majority of the services and APIs provided with Google Play Services that do not send identifiable information to Google servers. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>GmsCore</b>: Provides the core functionality needed to run apps requiring Google Play services</li>
                <li><b>GsfProxy</b>: Allows apps to use Google Cloud Messaging and send push notifications</li>
                <li><b>UnifiedNlp</b>: Allows for location data to be collected via Wi-Fi and cellular geolocation to be passed to apps that use Google's location provider</li>
                <li><b>mapsv1</b>: Replaces Google Maps API</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By using microG, no identifiable information is sent to Google. While a majority of applications work using microG as a replacement, some proprietary apps may still not work. To install microG, you must have a ROM that allows for <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/general/index-list-custom-roms-offering-t3557047">signature spoofing</a> or use a ROM with microG already implemented such a LineageOS for microG.</p>
