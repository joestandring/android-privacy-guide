                    <p>F-Droid is an app repository that contains only FOSS apps. In addition to the default selection, it can be extended by adding more app repositories. Almost all of the apps talked about on this page are available on F-droid.</p>

                    <p>If you still need to download proprietary apps/those not currently on F-droid, Aurora allows you to download any app found on the Google Play store without the need for a Google account. It was initially forked from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/">Yalp Store</a> but is more regularly updated and features a more intuitive UI. This is a better option than just downloading an APK as Aurora automatically updates apps and means you don't need to manually download apps from potentially malicious websites.</p>

                    <p>Tor is a system designed to make users anonymous when using the internet. Using the Tor network has many advantages over using a VPN service. Firstly, Tor is decentralized - meaning that you are not placing your trust in a company that is capable of viewing your internet activity and keeping logs. Using a VPN provider gives you the same level of privacy as simply sending your data directly to your ISP; the only difference being that it is sent to another company (who may or may not be more trustworthy). Additionally, Tor sends your traffic through multiple user-hosted nodes/relays in a network of thousands. More information on how the Tor service works can be found <a href="https://write.privacytools.io/my-thoughts-on-security/slicing-onions-part-1-myth-busting-tor">here</a>.</p>
                </div>

            <h2 id="vpn">VPN</h2>
            <p>This section will not cover VPN providers, but instead apps that support importing VPN configurations. For a good list of VPN providers, I recommend seeing the listed VPN providers at <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/vpn/">privacytools.io</a>. While these apps can support multiple providers, many first-party VPN apps may support more privacy features and may be more suitable.</p>

                <div class="device">
                    <h4>OpenVPN for Android</h4>
                    <img src="./assets/img/icons/openvpn.png"></img>
                    <p><a href="https://openvpn.net/"><i class="fa fa-globe fa-2x"></i></a> <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.blinkt.openvpn/"><i class="fa fa-f-droid fa-2x"></i></a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn"><i class="fa fa-google fa-2x"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/schwabe/ics-openvpn"><i class="fa fa-github fa-2x"></i></a></p>
                    <p>The majority of VPN providers use the OpenVPN protocol so it would make sense to use their app as opposed to downloading a separate (possibly closed source) app from the provider. OpenVPN for Android lets you import multiple VPN profiles and has useful additional features such as connecting to a specified VPN when the device is started, pausing the VPN connection when the screen is off, and reconnecting to a VPN automatically if connection is lost.</p>

                    <p>Similarly to the OpenVPN app, WireGuard s a protocol that is used by multiple VPN providers, and therefore such providers are supported by this app. While WireGuard is not nearly as widespread as OpenVPN, it features several improvements including improved performance (network speeds, resource usage, faster handshake) and updated encryption using more up to date protocols than OpenVPN. Despite the increased performance and security, WireGuard has various minor privacy issues such as storing IP addresses in the VPN server's RAM for the duration of the connection and not assigning dynamic IP addresses. These issues, however, are often circumvented by features provided by VPN services like <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/help/why-wireguard/">Mullvad</a>.

                    <p>Replacing the Orfox browser, the Tor browser for android integrates Tor protocols and allows you to navigate the web entirely through the Tor network. The app itself is based on Firefox and currently has implemented the majority of changes and features present in the desktop release. While this is the best browser to secure your privacy on Android, it may be unsuitable in cases where you may not want to use the Tor network. Therefore, it is recommended you also install another non-Tor privacy-respecting browser.</p>

                    <p>Bromite is a browser based on Chromium which patches out Google features that do not respect privacy (similar to <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">ungoogled-chromium</a>). It also features additional privacy improvements such as a built-in ad/tracker blocker using filters from multiple sources, DNS-over-HTTPS support, and other privacy patches. As it is built on Chromium, it performs better than Firefox-based browsers in the majority of situations and does not require patches to be implemented manually via user.js, add-ons, or about:config tweaks. Because of this, however, it can be harder to customize various settings and features manually compared to Firefox.</p>

                    <p>Similarly to their desktop releases, Mozilla advertises Firefox Mobile as a privacy-focused browser. Compared to Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, Firefox collects less user data and almost no identifiable information depending on the settings used. It also has more privacy features and settings built in that can be configured via a custom user.js file or by tweaking about:config. As well as a default release, Mozilla also has a browser with many privacy configurations already made, and additional privacy features called <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus">Firefox Focus</a>. For a fork of Firefox without proprietary code, <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec</a> is available on F-Droid.

            <div class="device_container">
                <p>An effective way to prevent privacy-invasive apps from constantly connecting to servers you do not want them to is to use a firewall. While this can improve privacy, it can also require a lot of set up and maintenance to block only the desired connections.</p>
                <div class="device">
                    <h4>NetGuard</h4>

                    <p>NetGuard is an open-source firewall that allows apps/addresses to be blocked individually without the need to root your device. As well as allowing and blocking certain apps, other features are included such as only allowing network traffic when the screen is on, notifying the user when an application accesses the internet and blocking advertisements and trackers using a hosts file. While the free version is feature-rich, the paid version includes additional features such as logging all outgoing traffic, blocking individual connections within an application and showing a network speed graph. As this app does not use root, it uses Android's in-build VPN functionality to monitor and block traffic. This unfortunately means that you cannot use this app alongside a VPN connection.</p>

                    <p>Another open-source option is AFWall+. Similarly to NetGuard, it allows for individual apps and addresses to be blocked and provides notifications when a specified app accesses the internet. Unlike NetGuard, however, it does not provide functionality for blocking advertisements via a hosts file and is missing a few additional features available in NetGuard. As this app requires root, it uses iptables as opposed to Android's VPN functionality meaning it can be used along with a VPN. Additionally, it means that it will be applied to all apps and will be more reliable as it works on a lower level.</p>

                    <p>The best way to ensure your passwords are kept private and secure is by storing them locally in an encrypted file. KeePassDX is an open-source password manager that uses encrypted database files (.kdbx, .kdb) to import and export passwords. This means that you can share your password-protected database to other devices to sync your passwords and reimport it, for example by using Syncthing or a cloud storage service. Similar to many proprietary and non-self-hosted password managers, KeePassDX supports features like automatically adding login information for new apps/websites, auto-filling login fields, and locking the app with a pin/fingerprint.</p>

                    <p>While managing passwords locally using encrypted databases negates the risk of them being misused, it can be tedious to set up importing and exporting databases and there is a higher risk of losing them accidentally (drive failiure, accidental deletion, corruption). While most cloud-hosted password managers are closed source, and therefore cannot be trusted entirely with your data - <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is an open source password manager that uses their own cloud service to store passwords. While the software itself is open source, however, they still have access to your passwords on their server. This means that you need to trust their security measures will keep your password safe. To ensure this, Bitwarden is audited regularly, with <a href="https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/third-party-security-audit/">reports</a> freely available on their website. Finally, Bitwarden performs all encrpytion on the client's device using AES 256 bit encryption before it is uploaded to their servers.</p>

                    <p>One of the most common ways to share and access files between devices is to use a cloud service. Often times, these are closed-source and require you to use external servers for an intuitive user experience. <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> is a platform that provides an intuitive interface and features that allow for files to be uploaded, and downloaded from either a user hosted, or external server. This means that all data is owned and controlled by the user, or a data provider they have selected so they can be confident their data is not being misused. Nextcloud also has some nice features that make operating with data stored using it easier such as multiple accounts, calendar/contacts synchronisation, and automatically uploading/downloading files on a user defined schedule.</p>

                    <h4>Syncthing</h4>
                    <p>An alternative to storing files on a single server is to automatically sync them between multiple devices using a service like <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. This negates the need for a central server that needs to be maintained/paid for and means that data is stored on multiple devices, so if one breaks you do not lose your data.
